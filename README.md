The CosmoTransitions package is a set of python modules for calculating properties of effective potentials with one or more scalar fields. Most importantly, it can be used to find the instanton solutions which interpolate between different vacua in a given theory, allowing one to determine the probability for a vacuum transition.

For more info, please read the [documentation](http://clwainwright.github.io/CosmoTransitions/). Older versions of CosmoTransitions can be found at [chasm.uchicago.edu/cosmotransitions/](http://chasm.uchicago.edu/cosmotransitions/).
