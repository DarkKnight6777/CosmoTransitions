CosmoTransitions is a package for analyzing finite or zero-temperature cosmological phase transitions driven by single or multiple scalar fields. It is written and maintained by Carroll L. Wainwright (a.k.a. "Max") (cwainwri@ucsc.edu), and is free for public use. If you use CosmoTransitions in scholarly work, please cite `Comput. Phys. Commun. 183 (2012)`_ [`arXiv:1109.4189`_].

Note that the current version (2.0a1) (available via github_) should be considered a development build. There will be bugs that I have not yet found or tested for. If you happen to find any, let me know! Or, better yet, fork the CosmoTransitions git repository and contribute directly to the code.
